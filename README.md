# Aggie_Keyboard
A Texas A&M style piano keyboard developed in Python using QT Designer and the winsound module for HowdyHack 2021. The user is able to freely switch between three audio presets: a Howdy greeting, the Aggie War Hymn, and the Spirit of Aggieland.

# Dependencies
[PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)

[winsound](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html)

# Usage
In order to use the Aggie Keyboard, the user should compile and execute project.py, which should immediately open the UI. The user then has two choices: simply click on the piano keys on the screen to play the piano, or change the song preset from the dropdown in the top left (shown below):

The user can freely switch back and forth between song presets, and play the keys however desired. To exit, simply close the UI.
